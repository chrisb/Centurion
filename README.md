A rad UI theme (and color scheme) for Sublime Text 2/3.

Ironclad is a darker, less green version of [Centurion](https://github.com/allanhortle/Centurion).

## Installation

Clone the Ironclad repo to your Packages directory. Here's what it looks like on OS X:

```
cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages
git clone git://github.com/chrisb/ironclad-theme.git 'Theme - Ironclad'
```
       
Make sure you have the `Theme - Ironclad` at the end of the command so it is placed in a folder using the right naming scheme.

Back to Sublime Text, press `super+,` to access your `Settings - User` and insert: 

```
"theme": "Ironclad.sublime-theme",
"color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Ironclad/Ironclad.tmTheme",
```

If it looks like crap make sure to restart Sublime before crying.
